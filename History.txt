IN THE WORLD HISTORY OF SDA

The Seventh-day Adventist Church had its roots in the Millerite movement of the 1830s to the 1840s, during the period of the Second Great Awakening, and was officially founded in 1863. Prominent figures in the early church included Hiram Edson, Ellen G. White, her husband James Springer White, Joseph Bates, and J. N. Andrews. Over the ensuing decades the church expanded from its original base in New England to become an international organization. Significant developments such the reviews initiated by evangelicals Donald Barnhouse and Walter Martin, in the 20th century led to its recognition as a Christian denomination.

The Second Great Awakening, a revival movement in the United States, took place in the early 19th century. The Second Great Awakening was stimulated by the foundation of the many Bible Societies which sought to address the problem of a lack of affordable Bibles. The spread of Bibles allowed many who had not had one to be able to purchase and study it themselves rather than just hear it preached, and led to the establishment of many reform movements designed to remedy the evils of society before the anticipated Second Coming of Jesus Christ.[1] Many religious minority movements formed out of the Congregational, Presbyterian, and the Baptist and Methodist churches. Some of these movements held beliefs that would later be adopted by the Seventh-day Adventists.

An interest in prophecy was kindled among some Protestants groups following the arrest of Pope Pius VI in 1798 by the French General Louis Alexandre Berthier. Forerunners of the Adventist movement believed that this event marked the end of the 1260-day prophecy from the Book of Daniel.[2][3][4] Certain individuals began to look at the 2300 day prophecy found in Daniel 8:14.[2] Interest in prophecy also found its way into the Roman Catholic church when an exiled Jesuit priest by the name of Manuel de Lacunza published a manuscript calling for renewed interest in the Second Coming of Christ. His publication created a stirring but was later condemned by Pope Leo XII in 1824.[2]

As a result of a pursuit for religious freedom, many revivalists had set foot in the United States, aiming to avoid persecution

BAPTISM
Seventh-day Adventists believe and practice the biblical custom of baptism by immersion, in a similar way that Jesus Christ was baptized by John the Baptist. 

This motion of immersion symbolizes Christ’s death and resurrection, which provides the forgiveness of our sins. By going through this symbolic act, we proclaim to accept Christ’s sacrifice and acknowledge Him as our Savior.

BABY DEDICATION

The Adventist Church doesn’t have a required age, minimum or maximum, at which babies can or must be dedicated. It’s up to the parents when they feel ready.

Most Christian parents choose to dedicate their babies within the first year after they’re born, with an estimated average age of between 4 and 8 months old.5

However, this may not be the case for every family. Sometimes new members want to dedicate their children, even if they’re much older than babies. This is perfectly acceptable, too. It all depends on the situation and needs of the family. If a family wants to dedicate and consecrate their parenting efforts in a public manner that involves their church family, no one is going to refuse!

BIBLE STUDY
The theology of the Seventh-day Adventist Church resembles early Protestant Christianity, combining elements from Lutheran, Wesleyan-Arminian, and Anabaptist branches of Protestantism. Adventists believe in the infallibility of the Scripture's teaching regarding salvation, which comes from grace through faith in Jesus Christ. The 28 fundamental beliefs constitute the church's current doctrinal positions, but they are revisable under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, and are not a creed.

BIBLE DISCUSSION
Much of the theology of the Seventh-day Adventist Church corresponds to common evangelical Christian teachings, such as the Trinity and the infallibility of Scripture. Distinctive eschatological teachings include the unconscious state of the dead and the doctrine of an investigative judgment. The church emphasizes diet and health, including adhering to Jewish dietary law, advocating vegetarianism, and its holistic view of human nature—i.e., that the body, soul, and spirit form one inseparable entity.[12] The church holds the belief that "God created the universe, and in a recent six-day creation made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day."
